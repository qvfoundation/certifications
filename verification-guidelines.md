# Qverify Verification Guidelines

Qverify certifications confirm:
- Implementation of post-quantum cryptography (PQC) per NIST recommendations.
- Correct parameter choices for algorithms (security levels 1–5).
- High-quality entropy generation sources.
- Compliance with NIST SP 800-208 for XMSS, LMS, and related schemes.
- Code-level verification of cryptographic primitives.

Each certification includes:
1. **PDF Report** — Full audit details.
2. **SHA256 Checksum** — For file integrity.
3. **PGP Signature** — For authenticity.
4. **Machine-Readable Metadata** — For integrations and verification bots.
