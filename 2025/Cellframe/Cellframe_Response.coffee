Response to Security Recommendations

1. CSPRNG Implementation
We have optimized and enhanced our random number generation in `dap_rand.c`. The implementation has already been utilized secure OS-provided sources (`/dev/urandom` on Unix, `CryptGenRandom` on Windows) but we have further improved the code quality and eliminated potential edge cases.

2. Side-Channel Hardening
While side-channel attacks are a valid concern, they require direct physical or privileged access to the target device. For our network protocol implementation where:
- Network latency provides significantly larger timing variations than potential side-channel leaks
- Attackers lack direct machine access in typical deployment scenarios
- More straightforward attack vectors would be available if device access was compromised

We consider this enhancement outside current SDK scope. However, we acknowledge its importance for high-security deployments and will evaluate integration of constant-time libraries in future releases.

3. Officail PQ test vectors - will be included in unit test modules

4. Legacy Algorithm Management
Deprecated and compromised algorithms (SIDH, BLISS, Tesla) remain in codebase for historical compatibility but are **disabled in blockchain operations**. For example, you cannot create a wallet certificate with a deprecated signature using standard API. We will review complete removal from codebase while maintaining backward compatibility for legacy integrations.

5. Documentation and Education
Comprehensive documentation covering algorithm selection, usage guidelines, and security considerations will be available in:
- Project wiki with detailed implementation guides
- CLI help system for operational guidance
- Developer documentation with security best practices

6. Key Lifecycle Management
Similar to side-channel hardening, advanced key rotation and ephemeral key management require infrastructure beyond network protocol scope. Current implementation provides adequate security for distributed network operations where:
- Key compromise scenarios differ from local device attacks
- Network protocol layer handles session management appropriately
- Enhanced key management would be deployment-specific rather than SDK-level

7. Continuous Security Monitoring
We actively monitor post-quantum cryptography developments, NIST standardization progress, and emerging vulnerabilities. Our cryptographic implementations are regularly updated to reflect current best practices and standards.

Summary: Critical infrastructure security (CSPRNG) addressed. Network protocol scope considerations justify current prioritization of remaining recommendations, with clear path for future enhancements based on deployment requirements.
